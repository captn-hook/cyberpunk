Bouncer:
	"Down a set of stairs, populated by a few hopeless beggars, you find a sleek metal door under a green neon reading "Afterlife". A thickly muscled man stands directly in front of the door, at the ready.

DV 14 perception:
	His eyes glow as he scans your group approaching
DV 17 perception:
	His eyes glow as he scans you, and you notice two bulges in the ceiling on either side of him, indicating pop down gun turrets.

He says: "Don't recognize any of you." as you approach

Intro: 
	"This bar seems to be straight from 30 years ago, for those of you who could get into bars 30 years ago. Green neon's shine out from under the bar tops, and retro gogo tanks adorn the walls. It is much more brightly lit than most of the bars you see in night city, the flat even lighting giving it a sense of unreality. There are a plethora of private booths and VIP rooms, some with muscle standing out front. It seems this might have been some sort of office space or something before becoming a bar, extensive renovations have made it very much a bar, but the layout is still odd.

Drinks are 15eb each, with specialty cocktails being 20. Mighty pricey for a joint with hobos outside.

Perception 16: You notice a man in familiar black tactical gear clock you as you come in, and he immediately gets up and goes to the bathroom.

if you catch up to him:

"Hey hey.. no trouble okay? at least not in here, you know the rules. it was just business."

Persuasion DV 18: 
"Oh, the 2k bounty? yeah sure man it was just a side gig. some lady sent me the info, her username was 'kibblybits.qween', i don't know anything else."

Persuasion DV 20:
"That big bounty comes straight from the UN. kinda a bitch because they want everything done clean and on the DL. shit, if i iced you right now they wouldnt even pay me, not to mention id probably be dragged through the streets behind a Charon by management. ""

Sneaking in:
Circling the building, you see a van pull up to the side and unload a pallet. He buzzes in at a panel on the wall, and a few minutes later a hatch opens in the ground. A portly women rises out of the ground on a cargo lift, and lights up a smoke as the delivery guy starts moving pallets onto the lift.
