Hour drive out of NC
On the way:
	"Driving out of NC, you go from mid rise building to beaten down suburbs. The suburbs are full of permanent tent cities, Piranhas throwing parties out of trap houses, and 6'rs brandishing iron and threatening vigilante justice to anyone getting too unruly. As you start to get out of town, you pass a church with a big white steeple, with hordes of kids running up and down the block out front. Past this, tall wind turbines and solar panels go on for a few miles, all covered with dust and littered with trash. Eventually, even these break away and you roll into a mostly deserted town and park in a large lot under a glowing CHOO2 sign. "

DV 15 Perception: Joe Hills of the Aldecaldos 
	"The parking lot is unusually full, a lot of the traffic seems be be Nomad from the paint jobs, and a significant portion is big freight vans. You see a few nomads milling around, one in a big Stetson smokes a cigar nearby, and is grilling something in the bed of his truck"

On anyone: DV 13 Persuasion to learn about a gun sale going on across the street, in a large abandoned warehouse. A guy out front will ask for a 15 eb entrance fee per person.

Inside:
	An old splintered wooden floor, stained from years of beer, holds a standing room only crowd. There is some space open opposite the bar, and you see a group of nomads throwing darts and a scream sheet with a face on the cover, titled "Billy Joe" Brentwood continues chop at SovOil." In the other corner an inflatable ring has been set up, and in the center a thin robot stands swaying side to side, with large teddy bears tapped to his fists. A bit of blood stains it's frame, and a man sits on a stool next to it with a t shirt that reads: "Team Teddy Fight Club".  On the floor next to it a display shows "200eb a play / 8-0 / pot: 1600 eb

Asking around: DV 15 persuasion
	Group of camo covered mercs in a corner booth, packing heat. They know about:
		Bullet bender at the afterlife, hard to get in tho. Easier if you flash some cash and say you wanna hire.
		2 mil bounty that went down in the combat zone, but they didn't have enough rep to try and claim it, the poster never responded to them.
