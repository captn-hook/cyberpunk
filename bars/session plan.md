Cindy is pissed someone put a bounty on her. She is even more pissed that it is only 2k.

"Sooo, it's super uncool someone put 2k on my head. You guys think i'm worth more than that right? Such a bummer. I need you to get in contact with this sniper guy and see where he got the bounty from. Like, someone out there knows who i am and has all my detes, and only put 2k on me? what the actual fuck. I've got to at least be worth more than a slam poet OMG."

Leads:
**Hideout in the combat zone.**
	"The old combat zone is chock full of gangers who were too violent or loathsome for the rest of night city. some scavs peck at the gear left behind by the constant turf wars, and unlisted AVs and trucks pull in and out, moving illicit goods. Cops don't dare head in, and even cyberpsychos can let loose without the watchful eye of MaxTac."

**Bounty ID camera system** -> Vegas DV 13 Interface:
	"All these bounties are dl'd from bootyfullbounties.forum.nz, a pretty obscure merc form that caters to anonymous purchases. You find the original posting for Ciorse and Cindy. Ciorse's listing had the exact time that the AV would start malfunctioning, as well as the general location. The entire post is written very formally, with certain stipulations on how the job should be done. Not too odd for a bounty of 2 mil. Cindy's, on the other hand, is posted as a comment on Ciorse's, rife with misspellings and bad grammar. If you had to guess, whoever wrote it had some insider info, but probably should not have been browsing booty full bounties in whatever state they were in. Still, neither post has the full identifying scans of the target, so anyone who wanted to take a shot at claiming the bounties would have had to reach out in DMs."

**Merc bar**: minty DV 16 local knowledge low quality merc bar on the outskirts of town, near nomad territory
	"Minty, you used to frequent a little spot at the [[Mega 9 Motel]], on the outskirts of town. Below the rooms is a dusty bar, and a CHOO2 station out front. Nomads do a lot of business outa here, preferring to stay out of the hustle of Night City proper.

**[[Afterlife]]:** DV 12 local knowledge check ->
	"You know of one of them most prestigious bars for Mercs in Night City: The Afterlife. None of you have ever been. Normally it is pretty hard to get in, but you could try."
