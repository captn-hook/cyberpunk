**Zoom2U premier car rental, right here in the corporate zone for your convenience,
is what says on the billboard sticking out of the squat concrete building. Azmat, you have been coming here everyday for the past week, except for Sunday, and already it brings you dread. The bosses have such a stick up their ass, and it seems the only people driving the Rayfield's downstairs are the personal friends of Tony, your boss. You just get moldy coffee and watch the other employees fight for dispatches.
