look at side hustles:
azamat busy doing job,
vegas could have helped recon or hustled

if vegas helps recon:
dv 15: 
**After a long drive for a customer, Azamat brings the work vehicle to an arranged underpass. 5 minutes after jacking in, Vegas gets the network architecture of the car.**

dv 20:
**Vegas notices some custom software in the car, implying the enemy has a netrunner.**

they can scope out [[zoom2u in NC corporate zone]] and try to follow the car

if they try to follow, it will try to run to the executive zone, where Arasaka will protect it

if they try to impersonate, they can drive him around. if he gets suspicious, use the techs skills & call in **Pirate** & trauma team (use arasaka troopers)

could go to Atlantis with him, his apartment, or home
