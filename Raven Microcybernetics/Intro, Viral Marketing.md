Raven Microcyb used to be top of the pile in the Cyberware game, but have fallen quite a ways from then. Still headquartered in Night City, they are completely vertically included, ensuring the highest quality, even if they don't have the newest tech. 

They have a contract with small, unsecured, PrePak manufacturing plant in the Heywood Industrial Zone to supply employee meals, called MicroSnacks.The plant doesn't do too many other contracts, making it perfect for targeted real world testing. 

They import flavorings, powdered protein, and grain. These raw materials are stored in their warehouse, mixed and formed, and then packaged and shipped out. If we can get them to try our proprietary LovePak flavoring this week, I can approach their HR director at an upcoming conference. I am confident that our amazing innovation will improve their employees productivity and loyalty, making it an undeniable boon to their company. We are hoping to get them in at 3 million ED a month.

Our "resident" netrunner has been monitoring them for two weeks, and is fairly confident that their will be minimal security between 11pm - 4am. On top of the ordered work jumpsuits, I thought you might want to use one of the work vans. You are not going to pass as employees up close, but hopefully we can attract less attention this way.
