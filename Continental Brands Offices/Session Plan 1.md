Cindy tasks them to hunt down the kibble queen, starting with the continental brands offices
Sniper Arnold is available as backup.

"Okayyy, our little trip to Europe is bearing fruit, and our outlook for this quarter is in the black for the first time! Hopefully if we can smooth over that little incident anyway. With our new funds and my recent promotion, our next strategic objective is to take on the competition head on. You are going to raid the Oasis super market and offices in Watson. I need all the information you can get on that bitch Olivia Forsythe. Even though this is a smash and grab, we still don't want to leave a trail straight back to us or let her know the hunt is on.  So! I had our PR head whip up some trouble online, putting the call out to local scavs that there is going to be some free kibble up for grabs. The idea is that you call in the scavs after taking out security. They take all the food, they generally wreck the place, and that covers up your search for the whereabouts of Olivia Forsythe. Also, we could call in that sniper if you need overwatch."

She hands you some face scramblers.

Offices house a grocery store on the bottom floor, with shipping and receiving under that. There is a small reception office in the back corner of the supermarket, with an elevator. There are 3 floors of offices above that and a penthouse at the very top.

They can find the 6 arm busker- get directions to a night market for cyberware.
The night market is attacked by a cyberpsycho if they go.
