Charade is a fixer, who wears a business suit and has a huge curly mustache. he smokes cigarettes, cigars in his office. he puts on the Top of the Hour market, which is one of the few markets that operates in the day. His trick to getting away with this? he bribes the cops, and generally, doesn't allow vendors selling anything too crazy. On top of that, his relations are so good with local authorities, that he gets tipped off about incoming lockdowns. And the crazy bastard, he makes sure his market is set up DURING the lockdown, allowing for some pretty big protection from gangs. 

Cindy gives the crew his number, and he answers the call lounging in a big chair smoking a cigar. With enough cajoling, he tells you to head to Watson as soon as possible, and then await further instruction. 

Once the lockdown starts, a newsflash hits many electronic billboards and is plastered all over
