6 arm busker plays a shell game

but he moves 6 cups with his 6 robot arms

players with speedware get the options cut in half, 1-3 instead of 1-6

he refuses to speak to you, and will instead grab signs with emojis from around him or write on a little whiteboard

he looks sorta homeless, but not that dirty or skezzed out

(backstory is he was modded by maelstrom, and his brain got a lil fried in the process
