players want to make sure they are in the right district of NC before the 24 hour lockdown takes effect. they only get notified once the lockdown is already starting.

if they try to sneak in or out of the district - very hard. probably will end up swimming the river.
they can probably get through a security checkpoint. especially with regular weapons, corp van, or help from boss.
if they get in without proper prep, they wont be able find a place to bed down, probably getting mugged over night.
