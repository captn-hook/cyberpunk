Slow, Compliant
Failed upwards into his new gig and [[National Foods]], but hey, that might not be such an enviable position, considering the heat that National Foods has begun to gather, and the vindictiveness of Continental Brands. Carl himself doesn't mind continental all too much, even occasionally indulging in cheese kibits, but a job is a job. 

Carl lives comfortably in the executive zone above new Westbrook

He hangs around club Atlantis, outside the old Corp Center. He drinks alone mostly, not important enough for other execs to talk to and not cool enough to have friends. Once he gets plenty drunk, he will often take a lady of the night to a Camden Court apartment.

He has a penchant for schmoozing at nice bars in the evening, and picking up some cheap infidelity. Not that his wife cares- he pays for all her paramours; her personal trainer, the pool boy, and sometimes even the maid. 

His House: A large fenced in mansion in the executive zone. You are not even getting into the executive zone without some heavy cover, it is guarded by Arasaka Troopers as it is within the executive zone.

His Apartment: Camden Court, in little Europe, is pretty secure, but known for Solos living there, leading to a pretty diverse crowd.
