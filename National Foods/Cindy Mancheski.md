Executive Rank 4
Junior Exec at National Foods, Night City Branch
Power Hungry, Driven, Young, Corpo Insider, Valley Girl, Vain

Short, but a commanding presence. Blond Karen cut, rather old world.
Severe face, extensive bio sculpts but not much visible cyber wear, except a pair of very retro Techtronika Cyber Eyes. 

Cindy look up at you all with a piercing glare. Her eyes are distinctive, Techniks, with the classic blue LED glow and a mechanical movement behind the irises. Besides that, she seems to note have much cyberware, you don't even see the metallic traces that would normally accompany her optics. Though, at a second glance, she is quite stunning, a little too pretty. A face that symmetric has gotta be a sculpt, right?
