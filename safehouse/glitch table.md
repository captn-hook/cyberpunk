| 1   | Cyberware Lag Spike   | A limb, optic, or reflex booster stutters. You move in jerky slow-motion, like buffering video.                           | -2 to REF-based actions for 1d6 rounds. Gun misfire or dropped item if you roll a 1 on any attack die.                                      |
| 2   | Echo Vision           | Cyberoptics or HUDs replay ghost images of teammates half a second behind. Everyone seems out of sync.                    | Awareness / Perception DV +4. If in combat, hitting enemies has a -2 penalty                                                                |
| 3   | Sensory Feedback Loop | Your neural link or interface plugs emit a shrill data scream. Feels like your teeth vibrate.                             | Resist Torture/Drugs DV 15 or be Stunned 1d6 - 2 (min 1) rounds.                                                                            |
| 4   | Phantom Notifications | Your agent explodes with alerts, messages from dead contacts, calendar events that don’t exist.                           | Distraction: -2 to all skill checks until you shut it off (1 Action). One message might contain a real clue from the net ghost.             |
| 5   | Reverse Texting       | Anything you type or say into a device appears backward, scrambled, or in someone else’s voice.                           | Social rolls using tech auto-fail until reboot. Adds creepy flavor for RP.                                                                  |
| 6   | Environmental Flicker | Lights strobe in perfect sync with your heartbeats. Screens nearby show your face distorted in static.                    | Everyone nearby makes a COOL DV 18 test or loses 1 point of Initiative from disorientation.                                                 |
| 7   | AR Reality Bleed      | Billboards, vending machines, and street ads start addressing the crew by name: “Love your work, [PC Name].”              | +2 DV to Stealth or Concealment                                                                                                             |
| 8   | Temperature Spike     | The room or vehicle gets suddenly freezing or scorching; breath visible or metal sweating. Sensors insist it’s 22°C.      | Tech or Cybertech rolls DV +2 for malfunctioning tools.                                                                                     |
| 9   | Hardware Poltergeist  | Drones twitch, neon signs flicker Morse-code patterns, radios play reversed audio. A faint voice whispers “Still hungry.” | If a drone is nearby, it attacks one random target once (DV 14, 2d6 dmg), perception dvs +2 for 10 minutes                                  |
| 10  | Ghost Sync            | All devices in range show the same face — a grainy image of the netrunner from decades ago — before rebooting.            | All agents, cyberware, and smartguns offline for 1d6 rounds. Anyone who saw it must roll COOL DV 16 or be visibly shaken (-2 to next roll). |
