the pop sensation played by a set of absolute ancient full body replacements.
they sport the old top of the line Gemini models, the likes of which have all but gone out of production. or so the corps would have you think.

these 3 ladies are absolute badasses, with tech that belongs in a super spy, not a pop sensation. one errant twitch, and they will know you are lying, one wrong move and your fried before you can draw your gun. 

but, being so old and so cybered, they are damn near psychos, living for the stardom and whatever amusement they can find. by now, their bar is very high, and they might just find that killing you is more fun than talking to you. 

they play at the atlantis a few nights out of the year, enough to keep their fans in high places happy.

rosy doll - caring and sweet, often imposingly so. her mama bear side is where the crazy shows through her manicured persona. She plays drums.

sarah sweety - bass guitar, huge heels, miniskirts, and a knife or five on her person.

karly queen - bipolar, and wears it on her chest. willing to go to bat for her girls. vocals and song writing.
