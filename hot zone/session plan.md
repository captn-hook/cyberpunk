Team gets a call the next day from Cindy, telling them that she has locked down some big contracts is on her way back and asking for a status report.

Ciorse in London and Paris:
You've been to the big cities in Europe, but your status as a dissident meant you never experienced them like this. Dragged along by Cindy, you go from office to plaza to club, 
meeting investors and buyers, showing them the potential of switching to LovePaks. This is the world you hated, glitzy buildings that tower over the suburban beavervilles and are miles away from the shanty towns. Unlike Night City, the class separation here is more complete, making it seem as though there might not even be an underclass. To top it off, you stop at Cindy's parents, taking in there gigantic mansion in the Paris SovOil executive retreat. They are cold, almost regal, and don't even spare a second glance towards you. They meet Cindy with a handshake, and as they barely look 10 years older than her, it almost sems like yet another investor meeting. You have an elegant dinner in a stately room, while they talk in hushed tones to Cindy. 

While in Paris, you do get to go to some of the fanciest stores you have ever seen with Cindy. Most of the mall is clothing or fashionware, but there are some more serious high end cyberware purveyors. 

Available:
100: Scratchers: Long, elegant nails with a razor sharp edge. Can change colors with just a thought.
500: Monofilament whip: A finger that can pop off, trailing a nearly invisible, ultra strong filament from the hand that can cut through flesh and cyberware. 
1000: Muscle graft and bone lace
500: Popup Grenade launcher (requires cyberarm: 500)
1000: Linear frame Sigma (requires bone lace, body 6)

As you fly back over the Atlantic in a charted AV, you stop to refuel at a drift city made of tens of oil tankers. Floating docks and rope ladders hang of the sides of this metallic island, and buildings made of recycled scrap and containers are stacked high on the decks. Around this behemoth of metal, little archipelagos of smaller ships cluster, and kayaks putter between them. From there, you fly over the desolate continental US over ghost towns and modified wheat fields, back to the west coast, and Night City.  

As you come in over night city, the AV starts to shudder and shake, then, the lights inside go red. Cindy's eyes flash as she checks the AV's computer, and sees that they have been forcibly grounded my NC air traffic control, for harboring a UN fugitive. With little control over their descent, she tells the rest of the team to come get her from the Hot Zone, in the old center of night city. The team can drive or fly in. As they land, scavs start circling, and the AV puts down in the street. 

The doors open, and the twisted remains of skyscrapers surround you, leftovers from the bombing of Arasaka tower. Old ground cars litter the street, most with their engines gutted. You can see a few scavs in masks, eyeing this AV that has just dropped from the sky and hoisting their weapons. A radioactive red haze hugs the ground, with the trash and detritus from years of salvage. 

For every round in the hot zone, roll a d6 and subtract the total number of foundational cyberware you have. Suffer:

0: Nothing
1: move speed -1 for the round   | your muscles feel weak
2: perception -1 for the round     |  its hard to stay oriented in this hellish place
3: move speed -2 for the round   |  you feel disorientated
4: -1 hp                                         |  you can feel r adioactive smoke in your lungs with each breath
5: -1 accuracy for the round         |  your mind goes fuzzy and you cannot seem to focus your eyes
6: -2 hp                                         |  your bones feel like they ache 

A round or two of combat ensues before the team can make it to them. As the team makes it to them, a sniper shot rings out, damaging their vehicle and requiring repair. as they start to clear scavs, more shots start to target Ciorse. If Ciorse goes down, they start to target Cindy until she cracks her TT card.

Team will be downed on the other side of the map from Cindy, 2 DV 18 repair checks to fix the vehicle. Helicopter cannot bring walking drone. 

[[Arnold the UN Sniper]] is half a mile away atop the ruins of a skyscraper. One player can make a perception check each time he makes a shot DV 25 to get his location
3 reclaimer chiefs in the booster trucks
2 outriders on motorcycles
10 road gangers in trucks that will run away


After saving Cindy and Ciorse, they can start to investigate this sniper. With a helicopter, they can get to him and chase him down. 4x ~17 DV piloting checks with some shooting in between to follow him. If they drive there, they can find his sniping nest and some evidence, Shell casings: 

DV 16 weapons tech skill to learn he has a Arasaka WSSA Sniper System, premium sniper rifle.
	DV 19 Local expert: notorious solo in Night City, the Bullet Bender
DV 18 perception: recognize the bike tracks as a sport bike, can follow tracks to the Old combat zone
DV 17 perception then DV 20 tech / DV 13 interface: high tech emplaced camera was left behind when sniper fled, with a program that identifies high value bounty targets, currently set to track Ciorse. If given a chance, it will also identify a relatively low bounty on Cindy from continental brands.

they get their bonuses (Ciorse can get it early, in Europe) they can shop 
They take a small penalty for the state of the offices.

they can find an undergournd schizo cetacean weapons dealer, a generic cyberware market, or an armor and tech shop run by a blind
